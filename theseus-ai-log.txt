Creating an optimized production build...
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.

You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

bug fix 1 ; 

the build problem was created by adding my 'repo' name to the file path during the build process.
it reads it from the "homepage":   in the package .json
solution ;  edit to "hompage": "" ,   (leaving the field empty ).
the file paths were all created with ' theseus-ai/static/css/ ' etc. So that they were all wrong.
resulting in incorrect <link> tags in the index.html <head>

this made everything inaccessable to the UI.(index.html after the build).

bug 2 ; 

black screen.


bug 3 ;
