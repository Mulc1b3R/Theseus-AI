    <!--
       NOTE: The use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
       will  cause incorrect file paths in the build process.
      running build will create a folder called'build' 
      inside , in the root dir are the index.html and all the image files,
      also the manifest.json ; react just copies the public folder to the root dir of the new build folder.
      it creates a folder in the root dir called ' static' containing two sub folders, 'css' and 'js'.
      use absolute paths instead of %PUBLIC_URL%/
      otherwise react will add a / to the beggining of your filepaths , making incorrect paths.
      Also , leave the "homepage: "",   field empty prior to running the build...
      otherwise it will add the name of you github repo to the built filepaths,causing even more 
      problems.
      
      The use of absolute file paths works perfect and avoids a whole world of issues.
