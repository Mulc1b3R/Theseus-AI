## Features
- Built in Dev server for viewing Web Pages. 
- AI Chat and HTML, CSS, and JS code generation using simple text based Promts.
- Token and price tracker enables user to see the current usage.

## Limitations
Due to the limitations of OpenAI's API, AI Web Designer cannot handle large documents with too much content.

The API has a maximum token limit of 4,000 per request, which means that the AI cannot generate large sections of code, or respond to the user when the document is too big.

## How to Use
To use AI Web Designer, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Access `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Once you have the tool up and running, you can start building your web page by asking the AI using the sidebar's chat. You can then customize the HTML, CSS, and JS code using the integrated code editor.
